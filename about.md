Hi! I’m Gautam Didwania, a Computer Science undergraduate who enjoys learning by building.
I’m currently exploring programming, problem-solving, and core CS concepts, and I love turning ideas into simple, working projects.
I believe in growing step by step, staying consistent, and learning from both seniors and real-world challenges.
